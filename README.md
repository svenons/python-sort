# python-sort - Part of my Programming II class. Open this in raw if you want to understand. GitHub shows it in a shitty way

Create 7 Python files:
	bubble_sort.py
	insertion_sort.py
	select_sort.py
	merge_sort.py
	quicksort.py
	shell_sort.py
	kartosanas_algoritmi.py
Create 2 data arrays:
	Random numbers from 1 to 1000 - 100 elements (digital array is regenerated when running the program)
	Random words 5-7 letters long - 100 elements (can use online generator and save to file, no need to generate every time)
Save the data arrays in the data.py file
For each sort method, create a function that receives an array as a parameter and returns an ordered array.
All methods must be tested with both arrays
All methods must be written by yourself
The method is called through the kartosanas_algoritmi.py file
All methods must take the lead time (import time, set the start and end times and subtract the difference)
Allows you to select the type of data (numbers or words) for each method
As a result, data, sorted data, and execution time must be output

Enjoy if you ever need them!
P.S. If something is wrong, contribute.
