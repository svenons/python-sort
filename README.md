Sorting algorithms in python
## What's inside?

To run this project, run the main.py file

6 sorting algorithms:

	bubblesort in bubble_sort.py
	insertionsort in insertion_sort.py
	selectsort in select_sort.py
	mergesort in merge_sort.py
	quicksort in quicksort.py
	shellsort in shell_sort.py

All algorithms remade with GPT4 as of 10.01.2024

2 data lists:

	Random numbers from 1 to 1000 - 100 elements (digital array is regenerated when running numbers() from data.py)
	Random words 5-7 letters long - 100 elements (takes 100 words from wor.dstxt file every time words() from data.py is run)

Other files:

	binary_search.py - binarysearch(arr, target)
	sequential_search.py - sequentialsearch(arr, target)
	non-specific.py - contains factorial(n) and loop_control_example(arr)

Enjoy if you ever need them!
